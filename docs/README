1. Clone the application:
git clone https://github.com/turtoiv/intive.git

2. Build the application
`go build`

3. Configure the database
In config.yaml file there is the configuration for MySql connection
The file should be updated with the mysql configuration. It requires 5 fields (my local config is below)
```yaml
host: localhost
port: 3306
user: root
password: ""
database: payments
```

4. Run the sql script to populate test tables
mysql -u root -p < sql_scripts.sql

5. Start the application
./intive config.yaml

6. Run postman (or another tool)
Add basic authentication (User:test, password:test)
