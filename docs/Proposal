Proposal

The implemented solution is slow , to process a transfer it executes
4 DB operations.

In order to speed up the processing an approach is to store the available amounts,
the transactions in memory structures (redis or something similar) and to use a thread pool
to do the DB operations.
When the request for payment is received it is validated and after that is queued and executed in the background
The request is removed from the queue after it is successfully processed by the db
